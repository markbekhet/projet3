// Note (Paul) : route pr√©sente avant le bugfix
// "The wildcard route will match any path. It is built using ** and will be used to handle non-existing paths in the application. It is called if the second Path does not match by placing a wildcard route at the end of the configuration."
// { path: '**', component: LandingPageComponent },
// Could be used for a 404 page for example.
// But we won't need it since we're using Electron, which causes that the user doesn't have access to the url bar.
// Therefore it is important to understand that we can't rely on in-browser navigation with routes, therefore we rely solely on the app's flow and the built-in app navigation that we create.
